# Sketch Replace Colour

Sketch Replace Colour is a plugin to Find and Replace Fill, Border and Text colours on layers.

By selecting a layer and running Replace Colour `(Ctrl + Shift + R)` on a selected layer, you will be presented with one of four dialogues.

## Fill only

If the layer only has a fill colour specified, the popup asks for a replacement, and which properties you'd like to update on all other layers `(All, Fill, Border or Text)`.

## Border only

Similar to fill only, the original colour takes the form of a notification, and further information is requested.

## Text layer

If the layer is a text layer, its colour will be chosen. If the text layer also has a fill, this will override the text colour (as it will be the colour you can see).

## Ambiguous (Fill and Border)

If a shape layer has both a fill and border specified, you will be asked to clarify which you'd like to use.
