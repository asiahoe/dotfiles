## Installation  
[Download](https://github.com/abynim/UserFlows/archive/master.zip) and extract the contents of this repository. Then double-click the UserFlows.sketchplugin bundle to install the plugin. Remember, this will only work if you are working with Sketch 3.3 or later.

## Usage

#### Generate Flows
1. Select Layers that you want to use as hotspots (one Layer or Group per Artboard).
2. If you don't need hotspots, select the Artboard itself.
3. Run the plugin from `Plugins` > `User Flows` > `Generate a Flow`.

4. Enter details for the flow and hit `Generate`.

_Note: The sequence of screens in a flow is based on the `x` position of your Artboards. Sketch does not allow event-tracking (yet) so it's not possible to determine the order in which layers or Artboards were selected, although that would be ideal._

#### Artboard Description
1. To enter a description for an artboard, select it and go to `Plugins` > `User Flows` > `Edit Artboard Description`.  
2. The description entered here will be added to the exported flow, and positioned below the artboard image.
